# run tests
- npx playwright test
# view test report
- npx playwright show-report

Installation notes: I used playwright version 1.30.0 as it was last version compatible with node 16.0.0, this allowed me to run React App and Playwright tests on my local machine at the same time.

Test notes: 
- There are 33 tests in total, across UI (16) and API (17), all written inside Playwright framework using typescript. These tests will all by executed on the same run.
- Some 'date modified/date created' UI tests are failing, the asc/desc ordering is not working well here, assuming the 'Name', 'Date Created', 'Date Modified' column headings are intended for sorting.
- There are also issues with API test parameters not being validated. Only order/orderBy should be accepted, but adding other terms, or ignoring case sensitivity does not throw an error.
- I left API\backend.spec.ts:342:5 â€º GET /api/charts?orderBy=dateCreated&order=desc 500 (345ms) as a passing test, as a descriptive error is returned stating work is still required, however this is on the assumption a card/ticket is created and In planning/In progress for this follow up work. I also followed this approach to show 500 errors working correctly in the system.
- I created a Jenkinsfile as example of CI/CD run, this can be run inside a pipeline, and intends to set up the React App initially, followed by Playwright and executes tests and generates a report. I have not tested this properly inside Jenkins on my local Windows machine, as there are known issues with nvm running on Jenkins Windows installation. Please accept this as an example of my CI/CD knowledge/experience working on Linux based systems.
